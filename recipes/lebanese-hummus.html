        <h2>What is Hummus?</h2>
    
        <p>
            Most everyone knows hummus. It’s the quintessential Middle Eastern dip made by blending chickpeas with tahini, garlic, and citrus. I grew up on it, and I'm convinced that this simple beige dip is some of the best stuff on earth! Creamy, satisfying and packed with plant-based protein.

        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Chickpeas (3 cups).</strong> Chickpeas, also known as garbanzo beans, are the star ingredient in hummus. Canned or dry chickpeas? If you're wondering how to make hummus from scratch--the best, extra creamy, authentic stuff--you'll want to cook your own chickpeas from scratch (you'll give them a good soak overnight + boil in water until well-done. More on this later)</li>
    
            <li><strong>Garlic (1 or 2 cloves).</strong> Start with 1 clove and make sure it is finely minced</li>
                
            <li><strong>Tahini (⅓ cup).</strong> Tahini is a rich, nutty and slightly bitter paste made from toasted sesame seeds</li>
                
            <li><strong>Fresh Lemon Juice (from 1 lemon).</strong> Fresh lemon juice is just the thing to add tang here</li>
                
            <li><strong>Kosher Salt.</strong> Just a pinch of kosher salt to your liking. You can always add more. If you're interested in adding</li>
                
            <li><strong>Extra Virgin Olive Oil.</strong>  generous drizzle of quality extra virgin olive oil is the way to finish and serve this dip the authentic way</li>
                
            <li><strong>Garnish.</strong> Not to be underestimated. My favorite way to garnish a bowl of hummus, once the EVOO has been poured nicely right in the middle, is a few pinches of tangy sumac (sometimes ground cumin is a good addition). If you have some extra cooked chickpeas, plant them right in the middle. For a pop of green, you can add a garnish of fresh parsley</li>
                
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps:</h2>
    
        <ol>
            
            <li>
                <h3>Soak and cook the chickpeas</h3>
    
                <p>If using dry chickpeas allow extra time for soaking (overnight) and cooking (2 hours).
                    Take 1 cup dry chickpeas and place it in a large bowl. Add plenty of water and soak overnight (chickpeas will expand in the bowl)</p>
    
                <p>When ready, drain chickpeas and place them in a medium-sized heavy cooking pot. Cover with water by about 2 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and simmer for 1 ½ to 2 hours. You should end up with about 3 cups of cooked chickpeas</p>
    
                <p><strong>*If using canned peas, </strong>give them a quick 20 minute simmer in plenty of water to help soften them some more.</p>
    
            </li>
            
            <li>
                <h3>Peel the chickpeas</h3>
    
                <p>Cover the cooked chickpeas in hot water and add 1 ½ teaspoon baking soda. Leave for a few minutes. Take a handful of chickpeas and rub under running water to remove the skins. Discard skins. Let the chickpeas cool completely before using</p>
    
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h3>Puree the chickpeas in a food processor</h3>
                <p>Dry the chickpeas well then add them to the bowl of a large food processor that's fitted with a blade. Run the processor until the chickpeas turn into a smooth powder-like paste</p>
    
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h3>Add the rest and keep blending</h3>
    
                <p>While the food processor is running, add 2 ice cubes, tahini, salt, and lemon juice. Blend for about 4 minutes or so. Check, and if the consistency is too thick still, run processor and slowly add a little hot water. Blend until you reach desired silky smooth consistency. At this point, you can cover and refrigerate the hummus for an hour or so before serving</p>
    
            </li>
    
            <li>
                <h3>Transfer to a serving bowl and garnish</h3>
    
                <p>Spread in a serving bowl and add a generous drizzle of good extra virgin olive oil. Add a few chickpeas to the middle, if you like. Sprinkle sumac on top. Enjoy with warm pita wedges and your favorite veggies and some warm pita bread.</p>
    
            </li>
